for cracking dreams;

3,dead souls,"as i shout
those 
sad lyrics 
onto the nakedness 
of those cold walled rooms,
the memories of those 
who deceased 
or left me
keep on dehydrating my lips,
as i starve 
of kisses and caressing hands;
starve of love and hope in general;
my laughter diminishing into
silence which is being
raped by irregular heart beats
of my decaying heart;
""while""

they keep on smiling 
looking how joyous 
i have become
without them;
but little did they know,
the yellow joy they see
is nothing worth to me;
""while""
living their happiness 
in a static phase,
a constant depressing phase;
as they remain stuck 
to all those 

paint-less ugly old walls,
walls that 
sheltered artifacts;
sheltered floors —
covered with 
now burnt oxygen that once travelled the
viens of all those depressed souls who died in that room...
those ROUGH walls —
weakened 
hopeless
strength-less
stare at me...

attempt to relock the door

to come back again

smelt aroma
of yours,

your presence via the fragrance of

skin;
as i enjoy your gentle baby hands
caressing my eyes,
that dim love in your decaying heart,
beating strugglingly,
meant for a character,
which sure i am!

i regain my eyesight...
only to realize that it was
just a
beautiful dream,

5,freedom,"manifestation of 
free mentality, 
a voice of heart 
that was meant to be free; 
not a strangled pigeon; 
crying, 
helpless, 
unsure of help! 

thoughts that weren't 
restricted to cottage houses 
filled with discarded furniture 
and untidy floors; 
broken crockery 
and noisy doors; 
no electricity and weak walls, 
no water and no well-functioning clocks! 

my glimmer has strengthened again 
as i shine in this darkness 
of void individuals, 
people with dead brains 
and caged souls, 
killing everyone who seems 
senseful and positive; 
differences are judged, 
happiness is cringed upon, 
love is criminilized, 
and peace is tagged as pollution, 
and freedom a poison! 

but my glimmer won't fade, 
neither my revolt for freedom; 
from the depth of darkness 
i will rise, 
from the depth of ignorance 
i will rise, 
because this is what human was 
meant to be 
THE ONE

6,cry for help,"the uncertainty 
in life,
as we trail through clouds 
i saw my dizzy head
melting like snow of those 
sad winters,

My dizziness fading into sadness...
i hope i get to live
my life again...
my hapless will crying for some help,

7,secrets,"spaces in mind,
filled with spice of love;
or poison of loneliness;
who knows?

that facial mirror expresses!
it sometimes feels
awful to be incapable to step inside
those secret memoirs 
present inside those head spaces,
that
i wish i could
just uncover;
heartbroken and unhappy 
i still cry
wishing that someone 
could just utter that cancerous truth
haunting my sleeps and peace...",2018-08-29,secrets,1678477949589,1678477950737,1678477950735,1,1
8,dead hope,"swallowing some O²
shedding some H²O;
started once again
to relive my world;
that died years ago 
after failing to lure me into thinking that
things would get better;
at least i tried 
to pretend happiness
in forms of fake smiles
and pale skin,
white hairs 
that used to hang with my hollow head —
their slaughtered tips
whispering into my ears,
how ugly and aged i used to look;
to u,
to me &
to everyone;
but i think let's start again;
for once
before the flames of jealousy
burn me to ashes... ",2018-09-03,dead-hope,1678478078673,1678478079821,1678478079819,1,1
9,perfectionism,"lame humans,
tired of spending fortune
to crystallize their already glassified skin
with toxins less fatal than their words,
less depressing than their intentions; 

crystallizing themselves 
to attract other lame humans,
that co-partner themselves struggling to survive their lust-based 2 seconds relationship 
meant just for orgasms,
sometimes fake for gaining more fortune... 

sell their bodies
for a late night drink,
34 packets of cigarettes,
just to raise kids that will die of trauma or sheer stress due to loneliness 

as they turn old,
their crystalls fell off
exposing their true scarred faces
with emotions of cancer
and appearance of poison...",2018-09-19,perfectionism,1678478211843,1678478212919,1678478212917,1,1
10,coma of trauma,"to be unhappy,
was not a phase,
it was an escape
from what 
we couldn't bear,
couldn't hear,
couldn't clear
from our
suffocating 
memories; 

wasting 
every pint of
the positivity we chose
dissatisfaction,
loneliness and 
daydreaming to run away
from all of yall;
thereby
entering

a dystopia 
build via daydreaming efforts of ours
and 
wattapad fantasies,
world that had wings
with no scissors 
attached to 
parents' or teachers' hands,
world where there
was no limits,
no loopholes in it...
just rum of freedom
that would
eventually toxicate our organs

no-one wanted to survive

fucking ocean

of darkness and 
depression... ",2018-10-01,coma-of-trauma,1678478359837,1678478362892,1678478362887,1,1
11,womanhood consumed by society,"just a dead soul
drenched in hopelessness,
tears falling from her eyes,
laying lifeless
on the bed of fortune and self-respect
accumulated by begging 
the foxes of this society,
as she stares on my hands,
looking like a lost puppy 

the blood of sacrifices
decaying her skin
as she weeps and asks for help,
from me 

i rush to 
wipe those heavy tears,
support those rotten limbs that were hanging onto a
broken and burnt skeleton 
while worms of revenge feed on her skin,
birds of trauma peck on her organs,
hapless and aching 
she asks me 
to KISS HER,
to CARESS HER,
to LOVE HER 

in response
i tell her that u r dying,
u need life support not love 
and she responds :
""i need your love,
not life"" 

i kiss her forehead 
as the bears of society tear down her flesh
as the hyenas of religion start pulling apart her bones 

but all of a sudden her breath starts getting irregular,
the smoke of hatred is now her new enemy,
the smoke seems dense and heavy as it collapses her lungs,
she screams louder in pain 

i feel so helpless
what should I do?
where should I go?
I ask her let's run away from here,
to which she responds :
""our love is pure,
this society isn't;
i was birthed and used by men to build the future that runs the corners of this society,
but now as i lay lifeless
people think i am needy
i am greedy
i am a witch and a liar"" 

and after saying that
she gets silent
and still
calm like a river after it floods a whole civilization,
calm like a tiger in disguise while hunting its prey,
calm like clouds that are about to turn into a storm;
she lies dead
and all of a sudden
i see the men of society leaving her carcasses to rot in vain

no one wants to burn her
because all they cared was the respect of her skin
not the sacrifices,
not the love in her heart;
this was the situation of a dead mother
eaten by the demon
called society.",2023-03-14,womanhood-consumed-by-society,1678774083833,1678774085084,1678774085081,1,1
12,jealousy,"within my heart
i continued igniting the chemicals of aggression and dissatisfaction,
burning in the flames of hatred,
murmuring ill-omens with my vile lips for you

hatred which was upsurging in me like venom
poisoning my soul

an explosion occurred suddenly
intended to destroy your pristine personality

but
your fate didn't let me destroy you;
unfortunately that explosion burnt me
spiritually,
emotionally and
totally!",2019-01-01,jealousy,1678774880197,1678774883827,1678774883825,1,1
13,journey called life,"crying for those who cheated with you
and left you to be all by yourself,
companionless
in those scary situations,
situations which were empty of optimism and hope

to weep till death
is actually useless,
because if they really did care for you and loved you,
they would have never, ever
left you alone

for you to escape from those awful situations, 
try to wait!
wait for time to pass out;
wait and just wait

as you bitterly,
broken so much at your tiny little heart,
as you see people leaving you 
when you wanted them to stay;
you will surely be slowly out 
of this emotional phase

as your hard time will leave you
you will learn how to leave 
cold~heart, terrible people
you will learn to not fall in love again
to not trust on people who will give you pain
but this cycle will be repeated again

you will fall in love again
people who are self~centered and heartless will make give you trustworthy vibes again
you will get alone again
uselessly crying for them again
because everyone knows 
life is an unpredictable journey of train
with no fixed stations
and
no fixed lanes.

16,silence of night,"in the silence of the night
when whispering becomes a noise,
the tap water droplets sound as they commit SUICIDE 
by falling onto the hard metal surface
of stainless steel utensils;
lying within the scullery all alone by themselves;
appearing forlorn and disconsolate;
the cause of their sadness being carelessness and oblivious~attitude 
of others towards their hygiene and cleanliness

this dripping sound becoming the only voice,
spreading the humdrum TIP~TIP melody 
throughout the deafened night~time atmosphere;
the monotonous notes touched by TIP~TIP sound
forcing into circulation high levels of adrenaline
through the blood vessels
of an individual as he walks into KITCHEN
for fetching a glass of water to quench his thirst

the adrenaline levels causing him to feel
extremely nervous and terrified,
his body sweating profusely,
his limbs trembling with fear,
as he continuous to sense the presence of spooky shadows
of ghosts and whispers of unknown bodies close to his ear

the silence of night
echoed everywhere;
